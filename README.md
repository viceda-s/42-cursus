# 42 Luxembourg - Cursus Projects

---

## 👋 Introduction

Hello! I’m Vicente (viceda-s), a student at 42 Luxembourg, sharing here the projects I've developed during the cursus. This repository aims to organize, document and make my code and learnings available. With each project, I strive to improve my skills in C and systems programming.

## 🗂️ Projects by Level

### Level 0 🔰
- [libft](./level-0/libft)
  
  Your custom standard C library, implementing common C functions from scratch to master low-level programming fundamentals.

### Level 1 🔰
- [born2beroot](./level-1/born2beroot)

  Project focused on learning Linux system administration basics and setting up a virtual server.
  
- [ft_printf](./level-1/ft_printf)
  
  A mini “printf” function, rebuilding formatted output for deep understanding of variadic functions.
  
- [get_next_line](./level-1/get_next_line)
  
  Read a file line by line with a custom function; essential for mastering file I/O and buffer management.
  

### Level 2 🔶
- [push_swap](./level-2/push_swap)
  
  An algorithmic project where you sort data using two stacks and a limited set of instructions; it’s all about efficiency and optimal moves.

- [minitalk](./level-2/minitalk)
  
  Send messages between programs using UNIX signals; ideal for learning inter-process communication.
  
- [so_long](./level-2/so_long)
  
  Create a small 2D game using a simple graphics library; introduces event handling and tile-based game logic.

### Level 3 🔶
- [Philosophers](./level-3/philosophers)
  
  Tackle the classic dining philosophers problem to master thread synchronization and concurrency.
    
- [minishell](./level-3/minishell)
  
  Build your own shell with parsing, execution, pipes, and redirections; brings together all your C and systems programming knowledge.
